# Portfolio

For this project I created a portfolio landing page with HTML and CSS. It has a sticky header and footer with my name and resume, respectively, along with a functional nav bar, which connects to the various sections of the page, inculding an About Me, Work, Ongoing Projects, and a contact list. Additional styling has been done by the addition of several images, colors, and other design elements.
